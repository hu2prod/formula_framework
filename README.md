# formula_framework
Javascript port of my old library for different tasks in physical calculations:
  * Measure value check (meters + kilograms)
  * Measure value scale match (meters + kilometers)
  * Precision band calculation e.g. 1±0.1 + 2±0.3 = 3±0.4

Now this library would have much more features. Stay tuned, some probably usefull stuff on the way.
